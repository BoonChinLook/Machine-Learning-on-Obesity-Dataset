# Obesity Prediction through Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict obesity levels using lifestyle and behavioral data.  
Dataset source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)

## Models Implemented
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Voting Classifier

## Key Findings
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (**86.44%**).
- Exclusion of weight (due to multicollinearity with BMI) improved generalizability.
- Stratified data splitting ensured balanced class representation.

## Contribution
Demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble models, particularly Random Forest, in early obesity detection and public health applications.
